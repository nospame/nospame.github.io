						<h3>Origin Story</h3>
					</header>
					<p> At age 16, while teaching myself CSS in a web design class instead of using the assigned software, I
						considered coding as a possible career path. I thought “why would I want to sit in front of a computer all
						day?” and too quickly abandoned the thought.
					</p>
					<p>
						Born in Seattle, I naturally worked at a career in coffee for close to a decade. I loved the
						environment,
						the people, and the coffee, but financially it was unsustainable. I tried moving across the country
						(twice),
						worked as a cook, helped manage a chocolate shop, and considered moving back to my hometown again.</p>
					<p>
						I found a job in state government: a basic office job, I thought. As part of a remarkably small team, I
						helped build up the state's interagency homelessness council, working with leadership pushing for policy
						change and expanded funding, and answered every question imaginable as our staff grew nearly tenfold. I
						supported our growing grants division by stepping into a vacant analyst role, pushed the state's first
						ever
						homelessness action plan over the finish line, and earned myself an analyst position for real.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the new role, I was again part of a small team &#8212; we produced the council's meetings, worked with
						our
						counterparts in other state departments, and wrote everything from budget letters to 70-page progress
						reports. Despite a great environment, I found myself drawn to the technical side of things &#8212; “What
						data
						do
						we have or what can we get? How do we present that information? What else can we do with it?” I am the
						rare
						one who genuinely enjoys Excel.
					</p>
					<p>
						After much research, I enrolled in a full-time coding bootcamp, understanding these programs can give a
						solid foundation, but that the commitment to learning would have to last much longer than twelve weeks.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am building a career in software development that I am just at the beginning of, recognizing
						now that it is so much more than “sitting in front of a computer all day”. As someone who enjoys a new
						adventure, has an eye for the details, and loves finding solutions to problems you only half-realized were
						there, I am truly excited to see where this field leads.
